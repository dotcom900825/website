    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    Designer: "Does it have to be a light bulb?"</i></p>

                <div id="brief" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <br><h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>Think about some of the designs that you consider to be great innovations. Quite likely, they came about because the design team was able to see a new problem or opportunity, or reframe things in a new way. As the light bulb joke illustrates, an important strategy of successful designers is to reframe things so that... we can see things in a new light. In this first exercise, you’ll build your needfinding, brainstorming, and reframing "muscles". It’s an opportunity for you stretch your creativity and have fun as you settle back into campus to begin the quarter. Also, the steps that you go through this week -- needfinding, prototyping, evaluation -- give you a mini preview of the design process we’ll go through during the quarter. This way, during the main course project, the steps of the design process will be more familiar.
                    </p>

                    <p>In studio this Friday (and every Friday), you’ll self-assess your work with the rubric below. Read the rubric carefully before starting; it’s your guide to success. The great thing about design is that you can meet the criteria for success in lots of different ways. Not all designs are good, but lots of very different designs can all be good, and you’ll see that diversity in your studio peers’ work.
                    </p>

                    <p>Here are two important take-aways we hope you’ll glean from this first week’s design experience. First, the early stages are worth their weight in gold because it takes just as much time to implement a lousy idea as it does a great idea. It’s worth putting extra time and energy into the first few weeks; it’ll pay a lot of downstream benefits. Second, while design is a lot of work, it’s also a lot of fun. Last year, many students reported that this was their favorite class at UC San Diego, and we hope it will be for you too!

To acknowledge and encourage this, each assignment offers a few points for this truly out-of-the-box work. Great design is also rare. So these points can only be achieved by at most 5% of submissions. If it helps, you can think of this as kind of like an A+.</p>

                      <p>To keep it simple for this assignment, we suggest you observe and test on a typical line — where there are people waiting in line for a service or good. You are free to get creative but keep in mind that it will make it more difficult for you to test your prototype.</p>

                      <p> Fidelity (how real things should be and what counts as a reasonable surrogate) is always task specific, and dependent on two factors. First, how long would it take to make it real? A banana is easy to come by -- maybe 75 cents and ten minutes. So if you need a banana, grab a real one. A text validator, on the other hand, would take longer. So there, you'd fake it for an early prototype. Second, how much benefit do you gain? If you were going to use a banana as a phone headset, the ergonomics matter. A picture wouldn't really cut it. But you could fake a banana by using a similarly-sized prop. </p>

                    <div class="col-md-8">
                      <p>Your intervention doesn't need to be a 'computer'. There does need to be a design. So if people are going to tell each other jokes, there's going to be some artifact prompting that. A simple sign would start, but my guess is that most would ignore it. So you might need more scaffolding (like a specific prompt, or rotating set of prompts to keep things fresh), and a screen would be one way to do it. This is your chance to warm up for the quarter and practice a complete cycle of human-centered design. All designs are fair game and the only limit is your creativity.

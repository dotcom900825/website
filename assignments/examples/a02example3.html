    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Brief:</strong> We tend to use social media as the medium to document events in our daily lives. Doing so shows how with every generation we become more and more digital when it comes to archiving our past. What makes these applications so much better and authentic enough in comparison to photo albums/ tangible items.</p>

                    <br><h4>Participant 1: Steve</h4>
                    <p>Steve is 30 years old and works as an IT guy at a lab on campus. Because work can get a bit stressful he enjoys going on Twitter on a normal basis. I felt that he would be a good candidate to interview because even though he isn't very old he is passed our generation. I felt that getting his insight on an application such as Twitter in comparison to insight from one of my peers would shine some light areas that I would never come across.</p>
                    <p>When Steve went on his Twitter, I noticed that he chose to follow a lot of celebrities rather than people he knew. It also seemed as if a lot of his followers were not his friends either. When I had asked him why, he told me that he enjoys Twitter because there's a sense of anonymity which allows him to post his genuine feelings and thoughts. He compared Twitter to Facebook and how Facebook is much more personable considering they call the people you connect with "Friends" rather than "Followers" along with many other things. We both agreed that when you have all of your friends seeing everything you post, you are less likely to post everything that is on your mind due to the fear of judgment. Because all of this tweets are so raw without any space to sugarcoat, he enjoys looking back at his tweets from time to time to see how he used to be and reminisce on the feelings that he felt at that time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Breakdown:</strong> When trying to upload a picture, Steve found himself wanting to write a little more than 140 characters (Twitter's character limit). He felt that it's nice that Twitter has purposely put a character limit in order to maintain its simplicity however there are times when it causes a struggle. Especially because he used to be a frequent blogger, he feels that adding that character constraint makes it difficult for him to write everything he is feeling/all of his thoughts about the photo. Because of the constraint he resorts adding a small headliner for the photo which "doesn't fully capture everything that I was feeling and when I look back at it, it doesn't mean as much".</p>

                    <br>

                    <h4>Participant 2: Elissa</h4>
                    <p>Elissa is a 21 year old student at UCSD. She uses social media such as Facebook and Instagram more frequently than the average user. She likes to go on both Instagram and Facebook when she's on the bus, walking, or even when she's with someone and has nothing to talk about with them. "I sound very addicted but I check every day at least 10-15 times".</p>
                    <p>Elissa truly likes Instagram because unlike Facebook, where you can upload pictures in masses, Instagram forces you to choose your BEST photo to upload. She spends a lot of her time choosing from a myriad of pictures from one event and then moves on to add the perfect filter. "Nobody wants to see your entire day up on their Instagram feed". Although Instagram didn't make up the hashtagging feature, she finds herself making up her own hashtags for trips and events because it serves as an album without really being an album. Because Instagram uploads pictures in a single feed the number of similar photos becoming overwhelming is never an issue. "And because you know that everyone has uploaded their "best" photos you learn to cherish it more and a lot of the times their photos become a part of my memory". She finds herself referring back to pictures of places people uploaded to serve as a list of places she'd like to visit herself one day. Although Facebook is very different from Instagram in a sense that it gives you many more options or expressing oneself, she enjoys it because it keeps you well connected by going much more in depth in to peoples lives whether it be through their photo uploads, status updates, or the links they post.</p>
                    <p><strong>Breakdown: </strong>When she was trying to show me a picture from a trip she a year and a half ago, she struggled with the fact that Instagram does not show the day it was taken in the "Month Day, Year" format that she was used to but rather goes by "Weeks ago". In order to work around that she has to sit there and calculate it out in her head. She said "it's not necessarily difficult to count backwards by weeks but it's very inconvenient and time consuming". She also ran into a problem with instavideos on her home feed. She wanted to watch them but a lot of the times she doesn't know how long the video is so she ends up watching all of 10 seconds then moves on to the next thing on her feed. </p>

                    <p><i>Left to right: (1) Elissa was on facebook when I walked in to interview her. (2) Looking through her past photos on instagram. (3) A close up of her page of memories.</i></p>
                    <br>


                    <h4>Participant 3: Mit</h4>
                    <p>Mit is a 26 year old who is an avid user of Snapchat. I decided to choose to interview Mit because I was curious as to why an application that offers such a temporary form of memory got such great hype within this past year. </p>
                    <p>Mit enjoys using Snapchat because it's a great way to see something funny, random and yet personal. On a daily basis he gravitates towards Snapchat when something random comes to mind and needs a way of instantly sharing it. Mit says that most of the time the things he sends are things that he doesn't want remaining for the rest of his life. Snapchat offers fleeting memory as opposed to long lasting memories and the reason it has gained such popularity is due to the instantaneous joy it brings to all of its users. Snapchat has the ability to be personal and yet remain very simple. Although each snap is brief along with brief captions, the entire compilation of numerous snapchats to each other over time serve as being memorable without being concretely memorable. When I had asked him why he thought a lot of people use Snapchat, he replied by saying that "maybe people who like to use Snapchat don't like to dwell on the past but more so on the here and now".</p>
                    <p><strong>Breakdown: </strong>Over the course his Snapchat usage, he noticed that he would have phases with certain groups of friends. Sometimes he wants to be able to look back and see who he used to send Snapchats to a lot and who he used to receive a lot from. Being able to do so may motivate him to rekindle some good friendships that he had in the past that happened to die out for whatever reason.</p>

                <div id="userneeds" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>User Needs</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Elissa feels like there are times when she just can't seem to choose ONE photo to upload. Allow user to upload up to a certain number of pictures per event; select the best photo as their cover photo and have it expand.</li>
                        <li>Elissa needs to be able to jump through videos on instagram because she doesn’t always want to have to watch an entire video that someone uploads. (It may be a cherishable memory to the person who uploaded it but not always to the people who are watching it).</li>
                        <li>Elissa would like it if instagram made their dates more in the format of Month, Day rather than by Weeks because she is constantly trying to calculate it out.</li>
                        <li>Elissa finds herself scrolling through a myriad of posts and loses track of the photos she has viewed/ posts she has read. Allow the user to have some sort of bookmark to clearly show where he/she left off last time.</li>
                        <li>Steve enjoys the idea that photos serve as a main instrument for extended memory. However, sometimes he loses track of specific memories correlated to that even or even his memories of said event may have become blurred(with time, with age, etc.) Steve needs a way to have the ease of photo sharing that exists but combined with the ability to write a short blurb or memory trigger that goes along with photos he has shared/uploaded. </li>
                        <li>Mit finds himself wanting to associate “the perfect song” with the videos he records on Snapchat. He     would like to be able to add a background song to in-the-moment videos because a lot of the times music helps to perfectly capture a moment and adding a funny track can make certain things THAT much funnier.</li>
                        <li>Elissa likes to keep her embarrassing tagged photos (on Facebook) because they serve as a memory for her. However, she finds that one way or another, someone is always able to view them even though she has privated them. She needs a way to be able keep all of her tagged photos and choose which can be public and which are for her eyes only.</li>
                        <li>Even though Elissa likes the idea of all of her pictures being on Instagram. There are times when she wants tangible pictures. She wants a way to be able to directly print pictures from her Instagram uploads. This way it will feel as if she has a stack of her best photos from her memorable events.</li>
                        <li>I noticed that Steve likes to reminisce on his old tweets on Twitter. However they don’t have a Timeline type of feature so the only way f or him to go back is by continuously scrolling. He needs something that will allow him to go back to old tweets from certain dates for example allowing the user to  search a date.</li>
                        <li>Steve feels that Twitter is clustered with too many unnecessary posts that makes his feed too difficult to follow. He would like way to limit the posts on Twitter to ensure that only the best/necessary posts make it to the feed. This allows a more precise and clear definition of ones memory as opposed to losing the more nostalgic/meaningful posts in a tidal-wave non-important thoughts. </li>
                        <li>Steve fears that the pictures he has uploaded is not audience specific. He feels that the emotions and nostalgia he is trying to convey will be lost between him and the people that views his pictures. He wants a way to make his pictures audience specific so he is able to properly and effectively convey his sentiments with those that share similar backgrounds, hobbies, etc.</li>
                        <li>Steve feels that much of social media is being geared towards younger people and that things are becoming much more brief/less detailed when it comes to documentation. He would like a way to feel as if he is not an outlier (much too old to be using these applications). Needs a way to document things in a fashion that is more user friendly for all age groups.</li>
                        <li>Mit believes that Snapchat is a very “spur of the moment” application. He thinks that it would be nice to have some sort of tracker to allow the user to see the pattern of whom they snapchatted at a specific time on a timeline. This way the user can see who they were closest to at specific times in their lives. </li>
                        <li>Steve finds himself favoriting a lot of tweets from his feed. However, it gets hard for him to go back and see all of his favorited tweets because it gets lost in the feed. He needs something that will allow him to easily refer back to posts he found hilarious/interesting/worth favoriting in a convenient location.</li>
                        <li>When people reply to Mit's snapchats a long while after he had already sent it, he forgets what exactly they are replying to. He wants to be able to see his own snapchats as many times as he wants in order to refresh his memory on what he had sent them.</li>

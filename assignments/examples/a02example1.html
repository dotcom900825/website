    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Observations</h2>
                    <br><h4>Task: What do you do for exercise?</h4>
                    <p>I observed each of my participants performing what ever they felt was their “average” workout routine. In order to expose myself to a range of point of views, each of my participants are at different levels of exercising expertise. Participant 1 has been been going to a gym and working out constantly for the last two years. Participant 2 does not frequently go to the gym, but wants to develop a routine to lose weight. Participant 3 is an athlete that participates in a sport outside of a gym. His workouts consist of both coached and un-coached training and consistently works out.</p>
                    <br><h4>Participant 1</h4>
                    <p>Participant 1 has a set routine every time he goes to the gym. I asked how he learned what workouts to do and he said it was mostly from watching fitness videos on YouTube. From that information, he developed his own routine. I asked him if he does anything to track his workouts. He said he doesn’t, but keeps a general idea in his head of what he’s lifted in the past and tries to improve on that. The participant seemed interested in the idea of having a better way to track his workouts. However, he felt that keeping a journal or updating a spreadsheet seemed like too much work. I asked what the participant’s goals were, to which he replied that he wants to maintain his current physique as well as tone the major muscle groups. Participant 1 also made the point that one of the most challenging parts of weight lifting is learning correct form. He said that it was something he struggled with when he first started and said that lifting with the right form is one of the most important things someone can do to prevent injury. Lastly, he noted that maintaining a diet has been very hard for him in the past and that he would have appreciated a way to keep motivated on a diet and track what he’s eating.</p>
                    <p>Main breakdowns I observed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Participant 1 doesn’t have a good way to record his workouts</li>
                        <li>Participant 1 would like to record his dieting</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><i>Participant 1 at RIMAC gym. At this point, participant 1 mentioned that the importance of form. He said that he had to learn things like where the best place to place your hands, as well as to make sure to keep your back straight and shoulders back.</i></p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Participant 2</h4>
                    <p>Participant 2 is an “amateur” exerciser. When I asked participant 2 about her workout routine, she said that she didn’t really have one. She said her workouts mostly consist of using the cardio machines and doing ab workouts, but she doesn’t use free weights or other weight machines. When I asked why she doesn’t use weights or other machines she responded that she wasn't sure how to use them and was worried she might hurt herself. I asked participant 2 how she learned what exercises to do. She said she mostly learned from others as well as her general intuition. She said that many online sources for exercises mostly catered to men. When I asked about her motivation to workout, participant 2 said she really wants to lose weight but feels she doesn’t always have the time to go to the gym. Finally, participant 2 noted that one of the biggest hurdles she’s had getting into a workout routine is learning the equipment. Between not knowing how to use certain machine, to not knowing if she’s wearing the right shoes, participant 2 said she’s been very cautious to not hurt herself.</p>
                    <p>Main breakdowns I observed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Participant 2 wants to go to the gym, but can’t find the time.</li>
                        <li>Participant 2 has a couple workouts she’s familiar with, but isn’t sure how to branch out to new ones.</li>
                        <li>Participant 2 has a steep learning curve and isn't sure how to move forward.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><i>Participant 2 on the treadmill. She only planned to use the treadmill on this day. This started the conversation about using the other machines.</i></p>
                    <br>


                    <h4>Participant 3</h4>
                    <p>Participant 3 has a significantly different point of view compared to Participants 1 and 2. Whereas Participants 1 and 2 workout on their own, Participant 3 is a football player that plays the Kicker and Punter positions. He works out every day both practicing his position as well as doing general strength and cardio training. Participant 3 has several coaches he meets with in order to facilitate his training, as well as occasional chiropractor visits to keep his body healthy. When not training with a coach, participant 3 practices on his own trying to apply the things his coaches tell him. When I asked what is the most frustrating part of his workout routine he said it was keeping track of everything he’s told from many different people. He also said that he often wants to record himself kicking, and play it back in slow motion, but doesn’t have a good way to quickly do that. Finally, one thing he noted is that he would like to record more accurate statistics while practicing, but often can’t.</p>
                    <p>Main breakdowns I observed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Participant 3 has to remember notes from several different people leading to confusion.</li>
                        <li>Participant 3 wants to record more information about his practices, but can’t.</li>
                    </ul>

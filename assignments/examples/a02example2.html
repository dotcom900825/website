    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Observations</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Brief:</strong> Due to a lack of cars, or in order to preserve the environment, many people use a city’s bus system as their main method of transportation.  San Diego, a city that homes three universities and is the sixth largest city in California, serves as a tourist hot spot.  This combination can cause extended periods of wait when using public transportation, so I decided to observe the transportation process of three different people whom use the bus at varying frequency.  Sagar Kadakia is a senior at UCSD majoring in Human Biology, and will be taking the MCAT in two weeks.  Sagar does not have a car and uses the bus whenever he needs to get somewhere.  Vinay Venkatesh is also a senior at UCSD, majoring in Computer Science. Vinay has a car and a full parking pass, allowing him to park on campus at any time of day.  Observing a user that rarely takes the bus will provide great insight on the conveniences and inconveniences of taking a bus.  Forrest Zhao is a senior at UCSD also majoring in computer science, and has a night and weekends parking pass. My goal in the observations was to figure out the status quo of the bus system (city and UCSD,) to determine what it already contains and what could be added to improve the bussing experience.</p>

                    <br><h4>Commuter 1: Sagar</h4>
                    <p>Roughly 45 minutes before Sagar’s class, he began to pack his bags and get ready to head to the bus stop.  He got on the computer to check the next arrival time for the MTS, and checked his phone for the next UCSD bus times.  After seeing the next bus arrived in 8 minutes, he seemed to have panicked as he clearly picked up his pace in packing up.  He rushed out the door and headed to the bus stop, walking at a quick pace, constantly checking his phone for updates on arrival times.  Finally, we reached the bus stop line, only to see it wrap completely around the corner.  Standing in line roughly took 15 minutes to get on a bus.  During the wait, the city bus passed by, but most students waited in line for the next UCSD bus.  Sagar said the route of the city bus takes much longer to get to school, so it’s worth the wait for the next UCSD bus.  He also mentioned that if the city busy wasn’t for free, he probably would never take it, which could be a potential issue for people throughout San Diego.  Once we got on the bus, all the seats were gone, even though there were two more stops, each of which had a similar line to ours.  About 15 minutes later, we arrived at school and Sagar showed up to his class about 5 minutes late.  This lengthy process explained why Sagar started packing up for class so early.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h4>Commuter 2: Vinay</h4>
                    <p>Vinay is a student at UCSD but lives in Pacific Beach and drives to school almost everyday.  I was unable to physically watch his transportation process, but I had him explain to me his daily commute.  I followed up with a few questions regarding the convenience of a bus versus a car, and what he wishes was different.  The following is a paraphrased version of my conversation with Vinay:</p>
                    <p>Vinay begins each morning by planning out his day in terms of transportation.  He needs to decide what time is best to drive on the highway, rather than deciding how much time he needs to get to class.  Having a car is very convenient in that he can park directly on campus, but parking on campus is also an issue sometimes.  On average, his commute ranges from 10 to 15 minutes, but that’s only because he plans his commute wisely.  If he were to leave during rush hour, the trip could last up to 45 minutes, parking inclusive.  He mentioned that it would be awesome to be able to use the carpool lane during rush hour if he had another passenger.</p>
                    <p>Having a car is extremely necessary for Vinay as bussing would take extremely long, every day.  Not to mention, he would be paying $2.25 per trip, which adds up real fast. Although, without taking the bus he has to buy a bus pass, which is also extremely expensive.  He would really appreciate a way to lower the cost and inconvenience of his trip.</p>
                      <p><a href="./images/a02e2p3.jpg"><img src="./images/a02e2p3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p><p><a href="./images/a02e2p4.jpg"><img src="./images/a02e2p4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>
                    <br>


                    <h4>Commuter 3: Forrest</h4>
                    <p>PForrest lives close to the bus line that passes through UCSD, but also has a night and weekends parking pass, which allows him to park on campus after 3:00 PM on weekdays, or anytime on weekends.  Most of his classes are in the morning, but he likes the convenience of being able to drive to campus in the evening, if necessary.  As a computer science major, he sometimes stays in the computer science labs late at night and requires a car because busses stop running at midnight.  I followed Forrest on a morning commute and an evening commute to gauge the difference of the commutes.</p>
                    <p>Similarly to Sagar, Forrest began packing up for the bus roughly 45 minutes before class time.  He left in a more “spur of the moment” manner rather than checking bus arrival times.  I asked him why he doesn’t check the timings and he mentioned that most of the times the arrival times are either wrong, or the line is long enough to make it useless to you.  He wishes there was a way to see the exact location of the bus to know when he should come out, but he just assumes it will take 2 to 3 busses to pass by before he gets on.  He was right, we got onto the third bus and it took roughly 15 minutes to get to school.  As we were one of the first people on this bus, there were some seats available for us to sit.</p>
                    <p>The evening was a different experience as Forrest was able to drive to his class.  This time he left 20 minutes before class, arrived at school within 6 minutes, and got to his class with 5 minutes to spare.  He clearly preferred this option as he seemed less tense, or in a rush, than in the morning.  I asked him which option he likes better.  He said definitely driving because, although you pay for a parking permit, the convenience is definitely worth the cheap cost of the night and weekends permit.  The full parking pass is way too expensive, but he said he’d definitely get it if we ever had to start paying for bussing because “we’d be paying too much money for an inconvenience.”</p>

                    <h2>User Needs</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Vinay wants to reduce the inconvenience of having a specified time of the day to come, so that he wouldn’t hit traffic.  He needs a way to find commuters in his area so that they can use the carpool lane on the highway.</li>
                        <li>Sagar and Forrest have run into times where they wouldn’t have a seat on the bus.  They need a way to have an idea of how many people are on a bus, before they physically get on one.</li>
                        <li>Sagar and Forrest have been stuck in long bus lines and sometimes it may be worth it for them to pay for one day parking on campus. They need a way to know how long the bus line is without physically being at the stop.</li>
                        <li>Forrest mentioned that the arrival times are sometimes wrong.  He needs a way to be able to determine the accuracy of an arrival time.</li>
                        <li>Forrest wishes there was a bay to track the exact location of the bus.  He needs a map which specifies the location of a bus through a GPS.</li>
                        <li>Sagar checked his the arrival times on his phone multiple times before getting to the bus to make sure the time didn’t suddenly decrease.  He needs a way to receive alerts if an arrival time changed significantly.</li>
                        <li>All three mentioned that transportation was expensive.  They need a ride sharing program so people without a car could pay less than a bus, and people with a car could drive people without a car, at a low rate.</li>
                        <li>Sagar and Forrest mentioned that bus lines add up, so extra busses could reduce the wait time in line.  They need a way to alert the bus hub that more busses are needed.</li>
                        <li>Vinay mentioned that sometimes it’s hard to find parking on campus.  He needs a way to check where parking is available.</li>
                        <li>Sagar and Forrest leave an arbitrary 45 minutes early to get to school on time.  They need a way to calculate when exactly they should leave, based on walking time to the bus stop, current bus line, and other personal preferences, such as if they’re okay with standing up or not.</li>
                        <li>The bus charges an awkward $2.25.  Bus users need a way to pay electronically so they don’t always have to have change.</li>
                        <li>Vinay says traffic is too heavy at times.  He needs a way to find an alternate route that may be longer, but faster at specific times.</li>
                        <li>For people who must pay for bus rides, they need a way to keep track of how much they’ve spent on bussing.</li>
                        <li>For people drive others to campus, they need an automated way to keep track of how much gas was used on the drive, so that the drive can get paid appropriately.</li>
                        <li>For people who live on campus and have difficult leaving, they need a way to get rides to various parts of San Diego.</li>
                        <li>Vinay could use the time spent in the car listening to class lectures, he needs a way to stream podcasts to his car speakers.</li>

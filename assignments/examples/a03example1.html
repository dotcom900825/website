    <!-- 
    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>The goal for this needfinding study is to understand what causes people to feel stressed. People become stressed when they…</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>feel pressured to complete these tasks by a “hard” deadline that was sometimes an actual deadline, such as an assignment due date, and other times a perceived deadline, such as a deadline that was most likely more flexible given the circumstances.</li>
                            <li>identify the underlying cause of their stress to be their own fault, even in cases when they actual cause was in fact something that was out of their control.</li>
                            <li>think their stress affects how they are perceived by others and how they affect people they encounter when in a stressed state.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To avoid feeling stress people…</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>distract themselves</li>
                            <li>accomplish something meaningful</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Examples of this include listening to music, exercising, and watching something on Netflix.</p>
                        <p>Stressed out people need…</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a way to be reassured that they can get through whatever is causing them stress</li>
                            <li>to set reasonable goals</li>
                            <li>to avoid procrastination and get their things done</li>
                            <li>to utilize music</li>
                            <li>balance avoiding vs. confronting stress</li>
                            <li>to incorporate exercise into their busy schedules</li>
                            <li>make progress (or at least feel like they’re making progress)</li>
                            <li>a way to escape reality</li>
                            <li>to take a deep breath</li>
                            <li>remember the good times and be thankful</li>

                    <ol>
                    <li><a href="https://lift.do/">Lift</a>: We liked this app because it captures the user’s need to feel like they are accomplishing things. This app lets you check things off as you make progress during the day.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/easy-volunteer-activities-for-kids-5.jpg">Time Capsules</a>: A time capsule can serve as a reminder or note from our past selves when we were in a different situation or state of mind.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/">Friends/Family</a>: Friends and family are often sources of reassurance and fortitude in times of stress. They usually have the right words to remind us...si se puede!</li>
                    <li><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiHome">Netflix</a>: Sometimes we just need a way to wind down and escaping reality is one way to do it.</li>
                    <li>Three Little Birds by Bob Marley: Music has the power to change our moods by pumping us up or creating a relaxing experience.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/us/">Exercise</a>: Exercise allows us to change our physiology and usually our environments as well.</li>

                    <br><h2>Storyboards</h2>
                    <p>Our first storyboard shows an idea where our application would challenge users to change their physiology to deal with their stress, in this case, related to school.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p2.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>
                    <p>Our second storyboard shows our second idea. In this application a user would be shown positive content to help them deal with their stress, in this case, that results from deadlines and a loved one's health problems.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p3.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                <div id="prototypes" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <br><h2>Prototypes</h2>
                    <h4>Prototype 1</h4>
                    <p>This is the Happy Thoughts home screen. From here the user can select from the “Stressed” or “Happy” options.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p4.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>If a user indicates that he/she is Stressed on the home screen, then they are shown a temporary loading page with some kind of entertaining image/loading icon (to minimize stress due to frustration) while the app loads the next page.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p5.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p5.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>When a user indicates that they are stressed, the Happy Thoughts app will load a relaxing/de-stressing content item. This can consist of an image, gif, video, webpage, voice message, etc. The idea is to allow the user to temporarily distract/calm/reassure themselves that they can conquer whatever stress they are facing and to remind them of all the good stuff in their lives. This page is showing a picture and message that the user sent to his/herself during a happier time to encourage their future stressed-out self.From here the user can go back to the home page (swipe left), view more content (swipe right), or select “I’m happy now” to indicate that they are no longer stressed.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p6.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p6.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Here our user swiped to the right to view more stress-relieving content. In this case another Happy Thoughts user sent this user an image and message. This demonstrates the power of encouragement from others.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p7.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p7.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>If the user swipes to the right again, they may get a different type of content. In this case, we are showing a song and message another Happy Thoughts friend sent to this user.From here the user can go back to the previously shown content by swiping left.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p8.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p8.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>After they view a few “happy thoughts” they are encouraged to get back to reality to face their stressful situation. However, if they are particularly stressed out, they are encouraged to select the “Unless” button to view some more content.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p9.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p9.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Here the user selected the “Unless” button and is being shown a video and message that they sent themselves</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p10.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p10.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>If the user tries to view more content after clicking the “Unless” option, then they are temporarily locked out from viewing more content to encourage them to avoid procrastination and get back to work. This screen shows an encouraging message for a few seconds</p><a href="./images/a03e1p11.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p11.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Then the screen notifies the user that they will be temporarily locked out of the stress app. However, to make sure our users don’t feel abandoned to face their stress alone, we provide access to a happy/relaxing playlist that maintains a de-stressing environment for the user.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p12.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p12.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Here the user selected the “Happy” option from the homescreen. On this page, the user can choose to create more “happy thoughts” content and add friends.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p13.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p13.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>If the user selects the Add Friend option in the upper right corner. They are taken to this page where they can select Facebook friends to add to their Happy Thoughts community.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p14.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p14.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>When a user adds someone, a confirmation message is displayed.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p15.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p15.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Suppose a user decides to add content, such as a video, instead of adding a friend. When the user selects the video tile, they are asked if they would like to record a new video or choose an existing video.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p16.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p16.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>This screen shows a user recording a new video.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p17.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p17.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>When the user finishes recording a video, they are asked if they want to Save the video to their Happy Thoughts media, Share it with Friends, or Retake a video</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p18.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p18.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Once a video is successfully saved, the user will see a confirmation screen.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p19.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p19.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>If a user chooses to share their video, they can select Friends from within their Happy Thoughts network to send it to. The user can also choose to add a personalized message to append to the video.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p20.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p20.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Here a user is adding a personalized message.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p21.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p21.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Here a user has sent their video (with or without the message).</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p22.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p22.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <h4>Prototype 2</h4>

                    <p>This is the Happy Thoughts home screen.  There is a slider bar inspired by the site ragechill.com where based on the input of emotional status of the user of how stressed to happy they are, the content changes.  This app will have lots of activities for the user to do so that by changing their physiology, they in turn change their emotional state.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p23.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p23.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>If the user chooses not to do the activity that is given, they can hit the X and their stress meter will decrease and they will be given a new activity</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p24.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p24.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>If the user chooses to do the activity and become less stressed, then their stress meter will increase towards being happy. Some activities are worth more points than others and will put the stress meter all the way to the happy end, other activities will require multiple activities in order to reach happiness.</p><p><a href="./images/a03e1p25.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p25.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Once the stress meter has reached the happy side, the user is focused and now ready to get back to work.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p26.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p26.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>If they hit the upper right menu button, then they have the option of looking at their profile or creating new content and activities for their chill/stress meter.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p27.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p27.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Here, they can upload photos or videos from the library on their phone as well as add a message so that they can create new activities or content to look at based on the their chill/stress meter.  Additionally, they have the option of sharing that content with friends.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p28.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p28.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>These are your top stress buddies that you can send destressifying content and activities to. </p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p29.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p29.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>You can change your who is on your top buddy list here.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p30.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p30.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Once the user has successfully added or shared their new content, they are given the option of where they would like to go from there.</p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p31.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p31.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

                    <p>Hitting the ‘Me’ after the menu button from the main screen will deliver the user here where they can look at the last couple of activities they have accomplished. </p>
                    <p><a href="./images/a03e1p32.jpg"><img src="./images/a03e1p32.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image" style="border: 0px none; "></a></p>

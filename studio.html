            Can we design a world without boundaries? And if so, do we want to? Many designs enable us to seamlessly maneuver between spaces, contexts and environments (for example: switching mobile cells). However, certain boundaries might be important for us (and sometimes difficult) to maintain (for example: separating home from work). Technology and design can shape our environments and create new boundaries.<br>
            <b>How can we design meaningful boundaries? Are there boundaries that we can 'push', or make invisible?</b>

        <p>South Africans have more ready access to cellphones than they do to fresh water. In a world with war, conflict, poverty and poor access to the most basic of necessities, mobile devices play a powerful role in connecting people with each other. How might we imagine leveraging our mobile devices to bring about a more equitable, livable and harmonious world?

        The government is going digital. As movements promoting open data in the public sector gain traction, more and more opportunities are emerging to integrate this data into our daily lives, allowing us as citizens to be more well-informed and engaged. Technology can be utilized at a variety of scales, from creating good in local communities to providing the momentum to fuel national movements. In the United States, election season is just around the corner, but political empowerment from the bottom up is not something that you might just imagine for this country alone.

          <p><b>Start with a challenge</b><br>
            Mobile devices are transforming health and medicine at a rapid pace. Diabetes patients can better manage their blood-glucose (chronic disease management), radiologists can flip through and annotate x-rays from their patient records in their pockets (diagnosis) , medical students reference key anatomy on fly (medical EDU), and consumers can stay physically active (health behavior change) - to name a few.  But the mobile devices that we see today don't always meet the design needs of their medical users.  Where do current devices and interactions fall short ? What hacks and workarounds can we observe? How might we better solve needs in health and medicine by redesigning the mobile health experience?
            Possible needfinding spots with the Stanford Medical School and PAMF.<br>

            Quantified self is a new movement centered around the idea that we can use data to collect information about ourselves. You may have heard of Nick Felton and his Feltron Report- it’s so popular now that it goes out of print shortly after they’re made available. When you collect data about your eating/sleeping/walking/living habits, you gain new and interesting insights into the human mind, and, more importantly, into our health. While you may choose not to go as detailed as such, this design brief will prompt you to examine the ways we approach our own health (as well as those around us) and identify and provide solutions for unmet needs.

        <h3>Cities</h3>

        <p>Even with the amount of time we spend communicating with people at a distance through a screen, face to face communication has not become obsolete and cities are the medium of choice for people to do this. Cities continue to grow in population all over the world.  People move to densely populated areas to be inspired, find opportunity, and to be a part of cultural events.  Jane Jacobs, an advocate for cities and a critic of urban planning practices that isolated people, described the successful city as a dance that encourages weak connections that inspire new ideas, but also conceded that  "Big cities have difficulties in abundance, because they have people in abundance.” One example of how cities have invested in digital infrastructure and policies to help their city run smoother, as well as help their citizens engage with the government and each other comes from the NYC digital Initiative in New York. What can we do here in San Diego?

        How can we design applications that enhance the best parts of living in a city while also minimizing some of the disadvantages?

        How do cities inspire design? What  can we learn from cities that can help us design successful online communities? What applications would only make sense if deployed in a city?

          <h3>Consequences of Ubiquity</h3>

            Mobile devices have become pervasive with people increasingly using them in all aspects of their lives. As a result of their size and portability, mobile devices can be kept in someone’s pocket or bag so as to be ready at hand 24/7. While the access to real-time data or information can be extremely beneficial, along with the access to real-time data is a constant stream of information that can fracture one’s attention. How might we design an application to help us filter the types of information that are being sent to us based on our context? Context might mean…
            <ul>
              <li>
                1. A particular setting (such as a movie theater where it is socially unacceptable to talk or text on a phone during a movie)

              </li>
              <li>
                2. While completing an attention-demanding activity (driving, cooking, studying).
              </li>
            </ul>
            Think about the many contexts in which you may need to filter the amount of information you are receiving, and think creatively about how your mobile device can be used to do this.

          <p>With the rise of AirBnB, ZipCar, Kickstarter and a host of book/bike/car/clothes/material and monetary sharing (crowdfunding, for example), we live in a world where we’re increasingly keen on sharing our resources in exchange for others. You may even have heard of the concept of a time bank -- where instead of saving and storing money, you’re storing time for services (e.g. TaskRabbit) -- and all of this helps reduce over-consumption too.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Are there unmet needs or underexplored designs and implementations in this area?
            </li>
            <li>
               How does the current state of the economy and recession affect these needs?
            </li>
            <li>
              Can we create good within a community or enrich our involvement with the community even further?
